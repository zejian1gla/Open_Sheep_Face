# Open Sheep Face: A Comprehensive Application for Sheep Face Analysis and Pain Estimation

Sheep, being vulnerable prey species, frequently
conceal signs of pain, which can lead to neglect of their
welfare. This poses a significant challenge as their suffering
may remain unnoticed until it escalates to a severe state. In
response to this issue, recent scholarly investigations have been
devoted to advancing sheep welfare.In an effort to address this concern, 
this project encapsulates the steps taken to implement various 
protocols grounded in prior research and
enhance them by integrating them into an application that serves
as a diagnostic tool for ensuring optimal welfare for sheep.

# Setup
For instructions on how to use the application, please see [Readme.txt](https://github.com/zejian1gla/Open_Sheep_Face/blob/master/Readme.txt).

# Functionality
The Open Sheep Face application is an all-encompassing pipeline designed to streamline the process of sheep face detection, head pose analysis, 
landmark prediction, and pain estimation, all presented through intuitive visual displays. 
This tool allows users to effortlessly upload images from their local devices and obtain prompt pain estimation results.

The application automatically draws bounding boxes around detected sheep faces and identifies essential landmarks. 
Users can easily observe and explore individual sheep within images featuring multiple subjects. 
This feature ensures that users can thoroughly assess each sheep's condition independently.

One of the standout features of this application is its efficiency in analyzing uploaded images. Within seconds, users are provided with results, 
such as the probability of face detection and a pain estimation number result indicating whether the sheep in the image is experiencing any discomfort. 

Overall, the Open Sheep Face application stands out as an indispensable tool for researchers, veterinarians, and animal enthusiasts alike. 
With its user-friendly interface, swift analysis, and comprehensive output, this application is a valuable asset in promoting the welfare 
and care of sheep populations.
